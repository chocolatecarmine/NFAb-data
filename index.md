# Transcriptional Responses to Necrotizing Fasciitis-causing *Acinetobacter baumannii* Infection

Welcome to my project page for the research on necrotizing fasciitis caused by *Acinetobacter baumannii*. Below, you will find links to my analysis and results, generated using RMarkdown.

## Project Overview
This research focuses on analyzing gene expression differences in macrophages infected with different strains of *A. baumannii* using RNA sequencing. The results are presented in a series of HTML reports, which you can explore below.

## RNA-Seq Data Analysis
